     * At each buffered local version, the given update will be rebased onto that local version, and the local version
     * will also be rebased on to the given update. Then, the stored local version will be replaced with the "leftovers"
     * of that rebase. This is because any future update received from the server is already on top of the given update,
     * even if its localVersion hasn't been updated. Note that this logic only affects edits to cell content where the
     * same cell was edited by both the server update and a subsequent local version (of which the server was unaware).
     *
     * This is the same logic as the server's `SubscriberUpdateBuffer` (see `KernelPublisher.scala` in polynote-server),
     * except that the rebasing logic for equal updates are opposite: on the server side, equal updates cancel each other
     * out, while on the client side, equal updates are preserved. Equal updates can't be preserved on the server, because
     * that would result in duplicate edits affecting the final state â€“ but equal edits must be preserved on the client,
     * because the client's edit has already affected the client's state. This has been experimentally verified to be
     * the only behavior under which concurrent editing reliably operates (see `KernelPublisherIntegrationTest` in
     * polynote-server, which simulates "keyboard-mashing" clients using the client-side logic replicated here)
